This unsupervised learning problem involves clustering movie reviews from IMDB. By clustering these reviews, the aim is for common sentiments and content across different clusters to be uncovered. By grouping similar reviews together without any labels, perhaps some patterns in the data can be uncovered. The process involves preparing the data, performing EDA, using TF-IDF feature extraction to convert text data into numerical vectors, and then applying the K-Means clustering algorithm. Once the models performance results are found, the model will be analyzed and EDA on the clusters will show any findings from the data.
